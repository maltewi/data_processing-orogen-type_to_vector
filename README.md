### The Type-To-Vector Task Library

This tasks in this library can be used as basis for data-agnostic Rock components, e.g. e.g data filters, learning algorithms or statistics. Typed data is converted into Raw data vectors and backwards internally. An arbitrary number of input ports can be added by configuration for any data type that is understood by orogen. For configuration examples, check the [examples folder](https://github.com/rock-data-processing/data_processing-orogen-type_to_vector/tree/master/examples).
